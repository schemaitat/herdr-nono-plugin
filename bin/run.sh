# Runs a plugin script with a known Node binary. Herdr spawns plugin commands
# with the server's PATH, which may not contain node (nvm, volta, brew in a
# login-only PATH), so the install step records the absolute path in
# bin/node-path and this shim prefers it. Override with HERDR_NONO_NODE, which
# may be an absolute path or a name found on PATH. Only shell builtins are
# used until node runs, so a PATH without coreutils cannot break the shim.
